## Q: Fragmentation as Method

### Making Myself Invisible

Q: Making Myself Invisible
from the series *Panoptic Segmentation*
2022, Thermochromic pigment print, 42 x 42 cm

The title of this work draws inspiration from the book *Making Myself Visible* by Rasheed Araeen. Araeen suggested that the question of identity is crucial for Third World artists, who should distinguish themselves from Western bourgeois artists. However, throughout my artistic journey, my inclination has always been to make myself invisible rather than visible. 

*Making Myself Invisible* was triggered by an incident, I was scanning myself using a 3D scanner and instead of exporting the file as an .obj 3D object format –as I should have– I exported it as a .png image. A three-dimensional me got then transformed into a fragmented two-dimensional self, an image where only fragments of my skin remained visible. To my eyes, the 3D scanner itself operates as would a surveillance system. It diligently gathers information about me as to construct a comprehensive three-dimensional profile. What was first accident turned purpose, my gesture forced a translation that resulted in the retrieved data losing its cohesiveness.

I decided to print this objectifying self-portrait using a
thermochromic pigment, such kinds of ink turn gradually transparent
when subjected to a raise in temperature. In Making Myself Invisible, this
raise in temperature is produced by means of touching the print’s surface; an element that is intended for audience interaction. I render myself invisible
to the viewer, and this almost immediately makes me feel safe.
