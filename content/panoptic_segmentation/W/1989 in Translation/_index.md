*1989 in Translation* is my first step up a Ladder. Here I walk you through my coming across a chapter in history that my disciplinarian education seems to have misplaced: the Tiananmen Square protests. Needless should be to say that, as a
student who had to sit through patriotic education, the impact these protests have had on my life is by no means inconsequential. 

This video work is a collaborative performance with Google Translate that delves into the intricate interplay between technology, politics, and personal experience. The text on the wall traces an excerpt from the first book I read about the Tiananmen Square Protest, a time when I had only just learned how to bypass the Chinese government's strict censorship by using a VPN to gain access to Google and other banned websites. The audio component of the piece features the sound of radio gymnastics, a mandatory daily activity for every Chinese student from primary to high school. I perform this exercise in front of Google Lens, while Google Translate generates illegible text blocks in response to my body movements.
