*1989 in Translation* marks my first step up a Ladder. Here I walk you through my coming across a chapter in history that my education have be misplaced (which I do not dare to openly discuss). In the video, the text displayed on the wall traces an excerpt from the first book I read about the protest after I began using VPN (Virtual Private Network) to bypass the Great Firewall. The audio component of the work featured the sound of Radio Calisthenics, a daily mandatory radio gymnastic exercise for every Chinese student from primary to high school. I performed this exercise in front of Google Lens, while Google Translate generated illegible text blocks in response to my body movements.
