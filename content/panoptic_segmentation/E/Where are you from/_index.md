*Where are you from* leads on a fluid journey through ice and rocks, light from straight photography about landscapes in European countries to images that are interrupted by errors in the darkroom during development. It constructs the narrative of the complexity of emotion, desire, introspection, and instinct, which questions the understanding of our identity and belonging.
