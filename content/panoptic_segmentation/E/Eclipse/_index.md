In Chinese, the word for photography is " 摄影 ," —“ 摄 ” means capture, and “ 影 " translates to shadow. Hence, photography in Chinese literally means capturing shadows. In contrast, the Latin term for photography denotes drawing with light. The question came to me: why photography, in the Chinese context, revolves around capturing shadows?

Through the meaning of capturing the shadow in photography, I acquire a valuable tool, a lens, and a medium to explore the possible illumination within shadows. The light within the shadow emerges as I explore to seek light in the shadow, as the shadow becomes an extension of my identity. I became the shadow in the meaning of capturing the shadow.

Capturing the shadow entails seeking out what remains discernible within its depths. Though dimmer than light, I can still discern traces of illumination within the shadows. Employing photography as a medium, I strive to perceive what becomes visible in the shadow. Photography provides me with the lens through which to explore the contents of shadows—to discern what is still perceptible, even within the darkness they cast.
