2022-2023, Archival pigment print, 25 x 525 cm


As a VPN user in China, I became accustomed to testing different VPN providers to assess their effectiveness and determine which ones remained functional while others were detected and blocked. This led me to navigate through various network agencies scattered worldwide, resembling a journey through virtual tunnels, in pursuit of unrestricted connectivity beyond the constraints of the Great Firewall.

In the work Shadow Theater, I traversed a physical tunnel instead of a virtual VPN tunnel. Instead of being guided by external instructions and collective memory as shadow figure in Chinese shadow theater, I chose to see my own shadow. I combined photographs of the shadows captured during the tunnel performance to form a continuous scroll employing the dimensions of the most famous Chinese handscroll painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival, measuring 25x525 cm. The act of viewing a handscroll painting, section by section, bears similarity to the way we engage with photography, embracing its fragmentary way of seeing. In the final installation of Shadow Theater, the display format was the concept of shadow theater.
