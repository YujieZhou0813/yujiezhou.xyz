### **Save as Text**
from the series *Panoptic Segmentation*     
2023, Jacquard weave      


The word text has its origins in Latin words such as textum (fiber), textus (fabric, material, or texture), and texere (weaving), which establishes a profound connection to textile and weaving processes. In Chinese, text is always translated as 文本 (Wénběn). From Oracle bone script, 文 (Wén) was depicted as a person's body with marks and drawings on it, signifying writing and carving on the body. On the other hand, the character 本 (běn) is both a pictograph of a tree and an indicative compound indicating the location of the tree's roots, symbolizing its foundation.

*Save as Text* resets to weaving as a form of writing. By following the root in 本 (běn), the project brings the text back to its textile materiality. Likewise, by following the meaning of “body” in 文 (Wén), my body becomes the tool for writing. Through weaving, the project rewrites censored text, giving it a new form that couldn't exist in its original written state. The woven creations serve as reminders of censored histories, events, voices, and memories.

The physical movements involved in the process serve as a form of healing. Despite experiencing physical discomfort and exhaustion, I embrace the repetition of work to leave new marks on my body, creating new text and memories. Through this process, I can generate new body memories that are not about obedience or manipulation but signify remembering, resisting, and refusing to forget.
