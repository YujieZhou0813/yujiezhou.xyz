## Panoptic Segmentation

Artworks from the series Panoptic Segmentation, 2022-2023, Medium: Mixed - Photography, video, performance, textile, printmaking, and publishing. 

Panoptic Segmentation refers to an image segmentation method in computer vision that allows machines to separate objects into segments. From a socio-political perspective, this method draws a parallel with the panopticon, a disciplinary mechanism based on continuous surveillance. Both systems operate similarly by breaking down objects into segmented components.

From a self-reflective critical stance, my practice seeks to identify, unravel and decode the mechanics behind power structures in order to tackle the invisible. I am eager to question the relationship between a collective political identity and our experiences as individuals. All with the purpose of deconstructing the notion of language so as to tear apart signifiers and reconstruct meaning.
