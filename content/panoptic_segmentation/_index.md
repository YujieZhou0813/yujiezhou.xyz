Panoptic Segmentation refers to an homonymous method in computer vision that enables machines to separate objects into segments. Similarly, from a socio-political perspective, the panopticon is a disciplinary mechanism based on continuous surveillance. Both our world and these worlding practices function on a similar basis. They are mechanisms, systems that can be broken down into component-based structures.

From a self-reflective critical stance, my practice seeks to identify, unravel and decode the mechanics behind power structures in order to tackle the invisible. By performing Chinese radio gymnastics while in dialogue with a censored history and a Google Lens reading; by ripping off letterpress prints engraved with Chinese characters that were formed using the Latin alphabet; by walking through an allegoric (VPN) tunnel in pitch darkness; I am eager to question the relationship between a collective political identity and our experiences as individuals. All with the purpose of deconstructing the notion of language so as to tear apart signifiers and reconstruct meaning.
