2023-2024, Site-specific installation, Sublimation print on barks.

In Finland, I noticed fallen pine bark scattered along the paths. The shapes of the bark reminded me of oracle bonesâ€”ancient Chinese writing engraved on them, which similarly has survived in fragments. Originally, there was no alphabet in Chinese; it was a pictorial language, like the oracle bone script. I began collecting bark during my walks in the forest, and over time, it accumulated.

Bark became a fragmentary writing material. I started to translate censored text I gathered from Chinese social media back into
the Oracle bone script and printed the text on each piece of bark
I collected during my walks in Finland over the past few years. I hope that in this form, there is still some partial remembrance of what is impossible to express.
