**Yujie Zhou** (b. 1997, Chengdu, China) is a visual artist working with expanded photography, textile works, moving images, installation, and publishing. Through performativity and a decoded notion of language, her practice seeks to interrogate dominant historical narratives and power structures while reframing collective individuality. 

Zhou is based in Helsinki, Finland, where she completed her Master’s degree in Arts with a major in Photography and a minor in Textiles-Materials and Structures at Aalto University in 2023. Her work has been exhibited internationally, including at the Finnish Museum of Photography, Photographic Centre Peri (Finland), Photographic Gallery Hippolyte(Finland), BFoto Festival (Spain), FORMAT Photography Festival (UK), and alpha nova & galerie futura (Germany) as part of Berlin Art Week 2023. She is set to participate in the Saari Residency maintained by Kone Foundation in spring 2024.
